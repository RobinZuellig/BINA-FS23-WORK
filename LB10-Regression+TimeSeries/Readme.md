**Regression Analysis** is the study of dependence: how does a response variable change as the values of one or more predictor variables are changed? In statistical modeling, Regression Analysis is a set of statistical processes for estimating the relationships between a dependent variable (often called the *outcome* or *response* variable) and one or more independent variables (often called *predictors*, *covariates*, *explanatory variables* or *features*). The most common form of Regression Analysis is *Linear Regression*, in which one finds the *line* (or a more complex linear combination) that most closely fits the data according to a specific mathematical criterion. For example, the method of ordinary least squares computes the unique line (or hyperplane) that *minimizes the sum of squared differences* (*residuals*) between the true data and that line (or hyperplane).

## B) Time Series

**Time Series Data**, also referred to as time-stamped data, is a sequence of data points indexed in time order. Time-stamped is data collected at different points in time. Whether we wish to predict the *trend* in financial markets or electricity consumption, time is an important factor that must now be considered in our models. For example, it would be interesting to *forecast* at what hour during the day is there going to be a peak consumption in electricity, such as to adjust the price or the production of electricity. These data points typically consist of successive measurements made from the same source over a time interval and are used to track change over time.
